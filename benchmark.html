<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PathGuide website: over 700 pathway and molecular interaction databases available to the general public</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ndexbio.org/">Network Data Exchange (NDEx)</a> - an attempt to provide a common public repository for biological network models of all types</li>
  <li>Benchmarks to aid in selecting the most appropriate networks for <em>a specific human disease</em> or <em>molecular pathway of interest</em></li>
  <li>Score of 21 popular human gene interaction networks by their ability to recover gene
sets that characterize a wide variety of diseases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<h1 id="databases">Databases</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Focusing on physical protein-protein interactions:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://dip.mbi.ucla.edu/">Database for Interacting Proteins (DIP)</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.hprd.org/">Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Concatenating protein interactions from multiple molecular networks with many additional
interaction types (e.g. genetic interactions):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de">ConsensusPathDB</a></li>
      <li>MultiNet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quantitatively integrating different studies and interaction types into a <em>single integrated score</em> for each gene pair based on the total weight of evidence:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.functionalnet.org/humannet/">HumanNet</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://string-db.org/">Search Tool for Recurring Instances of Neighboring Genes (STRING)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Score how well each network is able to recover a diverse collection of disease-associated gene sets</li>
  <li>Each gene set was randomly split into two subsets</li>
  <li>Ability of one subset to recover the other within the network, using the technique of network propagation under the random walk with restart model</li>
  <li>Recovery was scored using the area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC)</li>
  <li>The average AUPRC over repeated trials was calibrated against a null distribution of AUPRC scores from networks in which individual edges had been shuffled, preserving node degrees</li>
  <li>Comparison with this null distribution allowed the AUPRC to be expressed as a Z score, henceforth called the network’s “performance
score”</li>
  <li>Recovery of 446 disease-associated gene sets from the <a href="http://www.disgenet.org/">DisGeNET</a> database</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>
<ul>
  <li>For recovery of these literature gene sets, we found that STRING had the best overall performance</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/dNkueJ/benchmark1.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Noticed that many of the larger networks appeared to be the best performing</li>
  <li>Examined how performance rankings change when correcting each network’s performance for the number of interactions in the network:
    <ul>
      <li>The smallest network (DIP) moved to the top of the rankings, suggesting that, per edge, this network is most efficient</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/jWMpDd/benchmark2.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Did not find any additional network properties, other than the size, that is significantly correlated with performance</li>
  <li>Testing literature bias:
    <ul>
      <li>Removed all interactions in STRING and HumanNet that were based solely on text mining
        <ul>
          <li>Found that filtering greatly reduced the performance of HumanNet</li>
          <li>In contrast, such filtering did not greatly affect the performance of STRING</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Evaluated all networks on gene sets that had been constructed independently of literature mining:
        <ul>
          <li>Found that <a href="https://genemania.org/">GeneMANIA</a> and <a href="http://giant.princeton.edu/">GIANT (Genome-scale Integrated
Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues)</a> were the best performing networks on these expression gene sets, with STRING
ranking third</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Network integration</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Created a series of composite networks of decreasing size</li>
      <li>By requiring a minimum of two networks supporting each interaction, the performance was significantly improved over the best individual network (STRING) despite having a much smaller network size</li>
      <li>This configuration was optimal, and we call this optimal configuration the “Parsimonious Composite Network” (PCNet)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<ul>
  <li>When studying a particular disease, one might start with the networks that performed best on that particular gene set, instead of or in addition to the networks that were the best performers overall</li>
  <li>We were able to derive a much smaller PCNet that outperformed a network twice its size: this suggests at least one straightforward method of contracting the size of a reference network without sacrificing performance - requiring multiple database support for interactions</li>
</ul>
