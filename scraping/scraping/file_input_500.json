        "paragraph": "We applied the batch estimates to several scRNA-seq datasets. In the inDrop publication, the droplet-based sequencing was demonstrated on mESCs growing on LIF+ medium and two additional technical replicates12. In our analysis, we used two replicates that consisted of 5,952 cells from two batches and 11,308 genes with at least 2 cells having more than 4 unique molecular identifier (UMI) reads per cell. Data were downloaded as UMI-filtered read count matrices from accession GSE65525. Kolodziejczyk et al.14 explored heterogeneity in mESCs cultured with three different media (2i, a2i and LIF+) on full-length sequenced transcripts (Smart-seq). The three conditions included 219, 123 and 207 cells in 4, 2 and 3 batches, respectively. The mESC data sequenced with full-length Smart-seq14 were downloaded from ENA (project ID PRJEB6455) as FASTQ files and mapped to an Ensembl52 mouse transcriptome (GRCm38.p5.87, equivalent to UCSC mm10) with Salmon24. Cells were quality-controlled according to data derived from the Espresso database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/teichmann-srv/espresso/). Further, scRNA-seq has been widely applied in explorations of mouse embryonic development. To test the performance of batch correction for data integration, we collected single-cell RNA-seq data of mouse early embryonic development from eight different studies16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23, consisting of 56, 49, 124, 65, 15, 294, 17 and 15 cells, respectively. The early embryonic development data used have the following accession IDs: E-GEOD-57249, E-GEOD-70605, E-MTAB-3321, GSE53386, E-MTAB-2958, E-GEOD-45719, E-GEOD-44183 and E-GEOD-66582. All studies applied Smart-seq-based protocols for scRNA-seq. All FASTQ files were mapped to an Ensembl52 mouse transcriptome (version GRCm38.p5.87) with Salmon24 (version 0.8.2; k-mer = 21 to tolerate different read lengths). Here we considered the studies as batches while omitting the flowcell batches. We continued our analysis without further gene filtering or quality control. Kang et al.26 studied genetic variation among PBMCs from eight individuals as a replacement for cell barcoding in droplet-based sequencing (10x Genomics). From that study, we used three experimental runs: 3,514 and 4,106 cells from four healthy donors each, and 5,832 cells from these eight healthy donors. Human PBMC data26 can be provided by the authors upon request. Count matrices are available under accession number GSE96583.",

A methylation profile multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier was generated using the caret R package88, and was deposited in the GitHub repository abrarc/meningioma-svm (ref. 89). In brief, a linear kernel SVM was constructed using training data comprising 75% of randomly selected samples from the discovery cohort (n = 150) with 10-fold cross validation. 2,000 probes from each preprocessing pipeline were used as variables. The remaining 25% of samples from the discover cohort (n = 50) were used to test the model, which performed with 97.9% accuracy when classifying samples into three SeSAMe groups (95% CI 89.2-99.9%, P &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216).

These Ery-Pro cells are DAPI\u2212 Lin*\u2212 (CD2, CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD235a, CD45RA, CD123, CD7, CD10, CD90, CD135, CD41a) CD34+ CD38+ CD71+ CD36+ CD105+ (Supplementary Figure S1A) (37,38,71). The Ery-Pre cells are proerythroblasts, which were separated as previously described: CD71+ CD235a+ CD36+ CD45low CD117(c-kit)high CD105high (40). We next performed the colony forming assay followed by analytical flow cytometry to examine the colony-forming ability and descendant cell markers to validate the Ery-Pro purity (Supplementary Figure S1B). The results showed that Ery-Pro can only generate burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) colonies, with &gt;90% of the cells expressing the erythroid lineage marker CD235a (Supplementary Figure S1C\u2013I). Conversely, CD34 + HSPCs derived from freshly isolated cord blood can give rise to all types of colonies\u2014BFU-E, CFU-E, colony-forming unit-granulocyte/granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-G/GM), colony-forming unit-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM)\u2014with erythroid colonies accounting for &lt;40% (Supplementary Figure S1C\u2013I). Approximately 60% of the cells from the HSPC-derived colonies express the erythroid lineage marker CD235a, most likely due to the large number of erythroid cells in the CFU-GEMM colonies (Supplementary Figure S1H)., To investigate the chromatin architectural changes and enhancer dynamics in human erythropoiesis, we conducted the Micro-C assay, the Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) assay detecting H3K27ac, and RNA-seq in primary human HSPC, Ery-Pro and Ery-Pre cells, isolated as shown in Figure 1A. The Micro-C experiment generated over half a billion unique contacts merged from two biological replicates (Supplementary Table S3). Each replicate was generated from 100 000 cells and highly correlated at all resolutions for HSPC, Ery-Pro and Ery-Pre (Supplementary Figure S1J); therefore, biological replicates were then combined for subsequent analysis. Based on the contact probability, we found a higher frequency of long-range intrachromosomal interactions (&gt;1 Mb) in HSPCs but more short-range intrachromosomal interactions (&lt;1 Mb) in Ery-Pro and Ery-Pre stages. HSPC and Ery-Pro had fewer ultra-short range intrachromosomal interactions (&lt;10 kb) than Ery-Pre (Figure 1B). Comparison of compartments A and B among the HSPC, Ery-Pro and Ery-Pre stages based on the principal component 1 (PC1) value showed that 86% of the genome maintained the same compartment state throughout erythropoiesis, and only of 14% regions experienced compartment flip: 2% A to B (active to repressed), 3% B to A (repressed to active) and 9% transient flip (A\u2013B\u2013A or B\u2013A\u2013B, transiently repressed or active) (Figure 1C). We next examined the dynamics of topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, and found 5539, 5339 and 5418 boundaries in HSPC, Ery-Pro and Ery-Pre, respectively. Although the boundary strength was enhanced from HSPC to Ery-Pre, we did not observe striking differences among these stages (Figure 1D, E, Supplementary Figure S1K). We next examined the dynamic changes of TAD activity, defined as the ratio of intra-/inter-TAD interactions (72,73). Using the cutoff P &lt; 0.05 and fold-change (FC) &gt; 1.5, we observed only one significantly different TAD region in HSPC relative to Ery-Pro cells, and seven in Ery-Pro relative to Ery-Pre cells (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure S1L\u2013M). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the TAD boundary and intra-TAD interactions remain relatively stable during human erythroid cell development even with a minor but significant change of compartments. This is different from the previously characterized terminal erythroid nuclear compression process, which shows global disruption of domain boundaries and selective preservation of TADs and boundaries (40).] [The Micro-C, CUT&amp;RUN, HiChIP, Capture-C, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data can be downloaded at GEO: GSE214811.
