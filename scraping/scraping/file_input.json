The raw and processed data are available through Gene Expression Omnibus accession codes GSE264649 (scRNA-seq) and GSE266089 (scATAC-seq). Merged counts tables generated from scRNA-seq experiments need to be downloaded and arranged according to their associated annotation files to replicate gene coexpression patterns, while ATAC peak files need to be downloaded and arranged to replicate chromatin coaccessibility patterns. Raw image data from Airyscan imaging, intron-seqFISH, 3D ATAC-PALM and single-particle tracking experiments, due to their massive volumes, were not deposited but will be available upon request. We have deposited associated image quantifications (processed seqFISH, 3D ATAC-PALM and single-particle tracking data) and flow cytometry data at Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11406939 (ref. 63). For analysis of Extended Data Fig. 1d, our identified ACDs were aligned with LADs, compartments and ChromHMM-identified genomic regions of mouse ES cells downloaded from previous publications26,27,28.
