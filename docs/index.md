# AxoWise User Guide

## Overview

AxoWise is designed to help you develop **contextual biological insights** using **protein** interaction data, **functional** relationships, and **literature**-based knowledge extraction. It leverages multiple **interconnected networks** and advanced **AI**-driven techniques to provide meaningful insights.

### Networks in AxoWise

AxoWise integrates three key networks:

- **Protein Network**: Identifies and clusters protein communities based on interaction data, helping uncover functional modules.
- **Function Network**: Maps functional relationships between proteins to explore biological roles and interactions.
- **Publication Network**: Extracts relevant abstracts and knowledge from literature, linking biological concepts with scientific publications.

### Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG)

AxoWise utilizes **Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG)** to enhance biological insight extraction by integrating **vector database retrieval** with AI-driven summarization. This approach efficiently retrieves structured biological knowledge, enabling more accurate and **context-aware** exploration of biological networks and literature.

By leveraging:

- **Vector Database Retrieval**, AxoWise efficiently indexes and searches high-dimensional biological data, allowing for rapid similarity-based queries across publication networks.
- **Graph Retrieval**, which extracts relevant interconnected biological entities, ensuring retrieved data maintains structural and **contextual** relevance.
- **Augmented Generation**, utilizing AI-powered summarization and text generation to synthesize retrieved knowledge into actionable insights, integrating findings from multiple sources into a cohesive narrative.
