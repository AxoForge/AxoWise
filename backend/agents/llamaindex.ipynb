Here, Lawrence Young and colleagues discuss the effect of CD40 ligation on epithelial cells and consider the role of this pathway in the pathogenesis and treatment of carcinomas.\n",
      "The CD40 receptor is expressed constitutively on B lymphocytes, for which it provides important signals regulating clonal expansion, antibody production and isotype switching, as well as the development of humoral memory. The major source of CD154, the ligand for CD40, is activated T lymphocytes. Interactions between CD40 and CD154 provide a number of signals that play important roles in regulating the complex and multifactorial interactions between these two major cell types of the adaptive immune response. Understanding both the biological effects of this receptor-ligand interaction, as well as how CD40 signaling pathways are controlled, adds to our detailed picture of the complex interplay between B and T cells.\n",
      "Signals from CD4+ T cells induce two opposite fates in B cells: clonal proliferation of B cells that bind specifically to foreign antigens and clonal deletion of equivalent B cells that bind self-antigens. This B cell fate decision is determined by the concerted action of two surface proteins on activated T cells, CD40-and Fas-ligands (CD40L and FasL), whose effects are switched by signals from the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Foreign antigens that stimulate the BCR acutely cause CD40L and FasL to promote clonal proliferation. CD40L and FasL trigger deletion, however, when the BCRs become desensitized by chronic stimulation with self-antigens or when BCRs have not bound an antigen. The need for both Fas and CD40L to correctly regulate self-reactive B cell fate may explain the severe autoantibody disorders in Fas- or CD40L-deficient children.\n",
      "The liver is known to favor the induction of immunological tolerance rather than immunity. Although Kupffer cells (KC) have been indicated to play a role in liver tolerance to allografts and soluble antigens, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. We hypothesized that KCs could promote immune tolerance by acting as incompetent antigen-presenting cells (APC), as well as actively suppressing T cell activation induced by other potent APCs. The expression of antigen presentation-related molecules by KCs was phenotyped by flow cytometry. The abilities of KCs to act as APCs and to suppress T cell activation induced by splenic dendritic cells (DC) were examined by in vitro proliferation assays using CD4(+) OVA-TCR (ovalbumin T cell receptor) transgenic T cells. We found that, compared with DCs, KCs expressed significantly lower levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, B7-1, B7-2, and CD40. This result is consistent with our observation that KCs were not as potent as DCs in eliciting OVA-specific T cell proliferation. However, KCs isolated from polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-treated mice expressed significantly higher levels of MHC II and costimulatory molecules than did naïve KCs and could stimulate stronger T cell responses. More importantly, we found that KCs could inhibit DC-induced OVA-specific T cell activation. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that prostaglandins produced by KCs played an important role. The results ruled out the possible involvement of interleukin-10, nitric oxide, 2,3-dioxygenase, and transforming growth factor beta in KC-mediated T cell suppression.Our data indicate that KCs are a tolerogenic APC population within the liver. These findings suggest that KCs may play a critical role in regulating immune reactions within the liver and contributing to liver-mediated systemic immune tolerance. (HEPATOLOGY 2008.).\n",
      "T lymphocytes recirculate continually through the T cell areas of peripheral lymph nodes. During each passage, the T cells survey the surface of large dendritic cells (DCs), also known as interdigitating cells. However, these DCs have been difficult to release from the lymph node. By emphasizing the use of calcium-free media, as shown by Vremec et al. (Vremec, D., M. Zorbas, R. Scollay, D.J. Saunders, C.F. Ardavin, L. Wu, and K. Shortman. 1992. J. Exp. Med. 176:47-58.), we have been able to release and enrich DCs from the T cell areas. The DCs express the CD11c leukocyte integrin, the DEC-205 multilectin receptor for antigen presentation, the intracellular granule antigens which are recognized by monoclonal antibodies M342, 2A1, and MIDC-8, very high levels of MHC I and MHC II, and abundant accessory molecules such as CD40, CD54, and CD86. When examined with the Y-Ae monoclonal which recognizes complexes formed between I-Ab and a peptide derived from I-Ealpha, the T cell area DCs expressed the highest levels. The enriched DCs also stimulated a T-T hybridoma specific for this MHC II-peptide complex, and the hybridoma underwent apoptosis. Therefore DCs within the T cell areas can be isolated. Because they present very high levels of self peptides, these DCs should be considered in the regulation of self reactivity in the periphery.\n",

      "Answer: The role of CD40 includes regulating immune responses, particularly in B lymphocytes and T cells. It provides signals for clonal expansion, antibody production, and isotype switching in B cells, and helps in the development of humoral memory. In epithelial cells, CD40 ligation can influence their behavior, possibly contributing to carcinomas. The interaction between CD40 and its ligand (CD154) plays a crucial role in regulating the interactions between B and T cells.
